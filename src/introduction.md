# Introduction

Remotia is an [open-source](https://github.com/remotia) media processing and streaming framework written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).
While being designed with remote rendering and cloud gaming in mind, its components are versatile and can be used in a variety of contexts. 
Bindings and plug-and-play modules for well-enstablished libraries such as [ffmpeg](https://github.com/remotia/remotia-ffmpeg-codecs) and the [SRT protocol](https://github.com/remotia/remotia-srt) are available, while more are in development and will be released soon.

Remotia is actively used for research projects of the [IPLab](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/) of the University of Catania.
